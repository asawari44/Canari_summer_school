### INTRODUCTION
Depression is a serious and common mental disorder and needs proper care and treatment. It is treatable; around 80 to 90% patients diagnosed with depression eventually respond well to the medical treatment. medication, psychotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy can help patients feel better over a period of time but the full effect cannot be seen for one or two months. It is important for patients to clearly communicate with their psychiatrist in case they do not feel any better or if the situation drastically worsens after being prescribed to antidepressants. This helps psychiatrists decide the changes in the medication type or dosage[6]. In this current process of treatment, we believe that our solution ‘Canari : Your digital companion in mental health’ can be helpful to both the practitioners and patients to understand the improvement and milestones during the treatment. 


### SOLUTION
The solution has two sides - a mobile application for patients and a desktop application for medical practitioners. The patient application uses mobile sensors such as the accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS to track continuous movement data such as exercise, time spent resting, and total time away from home. Patients can use the mobile app to see and control the data being collected, and see highlighted insights about their progress. In addition, patients can access other communication and journaling features for coping with their symptoms.
Practitioner's portal on the other side will show valuable insights collected from the user data and help doctor's determine if the treatment is going as expected. They can gather enough data to understand if the medication or dosage needs to be changed and if the condition is improving at all.
